Rules to implement:
Line growth
- "Grow" (more like complete) chunks along edges of the board until they according to the size of the first or last clue
Chunk connecting (advanced)
- Recognize which cells must belong to the same chunk (tricky with multiple clues per line - new data structures maybe?)
    - Fill the known chunks
    - Put Xs between separated chunks
        - Basic solution: see which connections would exceed the maximum block size given throgh clues
