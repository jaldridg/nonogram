Strategies to implement

Block Data structure
    - Instead of storing tiles, store blocks which are stretches of the same tile type
    - OOXXOO???X would be stored as 2O, 2X, 2O, 3? 1X
	- Powerful since each block must belong to the same clue and we can loop over each block instead of each tile
    - Using this data structure
        - We will know which cells belong to which clues
        - We will know whether a clue has been solved

Replace line operations with block operations

See if we can turn lineGrowth beginning and end into one function with parameters that "select" whether to do end or beginning
