Rules
"2/n + 1": Occurs when there are enough colors in a row/col such that you can be certain that there are some in the middle of the row/col
Test cases in order of complexity when given an nxn board:
- Fill in board when there's n in one row
- Fill in what you can with at least 2/n + 1 in a row
- Fill board when given region r and region m such that r + m + 1 = n
    In other words, two regions and their gap fills up the row 
- Expand previous step for any number of regions
