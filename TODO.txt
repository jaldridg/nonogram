Strategies to implement

Line Shrinkage
- Only applies to a single clue line
- When at least one tile is filled, we know that the block must be that area, so fill the distant cells with Xs

Certainty Rule #2:
- Basically a redo of the first rule, but counts the Xs as well as clue sizes when accounting for surrounding spaces
- Might be able to incorporate this in the preexisting rule
    - In that case, we'd have to make this a recurring check

Block growth: "Grow" (more like complete) blocks when there is only one way for them to expand
- By starting at the edges, we know the first/last filled tile we encounter belongs to the first/last clue
- Also a fill of a whole block means we can also cap the block with an X since there cannot be another filled tile there
    - Level 1: Along edges of the board
    - Level 2: Start at the edges of the board and move inwards until there's an unknown tile
        - We'd probably count what we come across and determine what the adjacent unknown tiles are
    - Level 3: Grow when there are unknown tiles between the first block
        - For example if there was a 5 clue and a filled tile second from the right...
        ...we'd know there are more filled tiles to the right since the 5 block is big enough

Gap filling: Get rid of small gaps (in between two Xs for example) which cannot fit a large block
- Basic solution: Fill any gap which is smaller than our smallest block in the line
- Better solution: Same as above but be more aware of which blocks may actually fill the gap
    - For example if we have a 7,3 in a 15x15 board, a gap of 3 on the left should be filled since 7 must be in the left side

Block connecting (advanced)
- Might share some techniques with line growth
- Recognize which cells must belong to the same block (tricky with multiple clues per line - new data structures maybe?)
    - Fill the known blocks
    - Put Xs between separated blocks
        - Basic solution: see which connections would exceed the maximum block size given throgh clues
